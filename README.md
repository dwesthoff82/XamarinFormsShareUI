# XamarinFormsShareUI

This is a very simple project that encapsulates some custom classes to better allow me to use Xamarin.Forms for richer UI scenarios.

I recently returned to this project and I am working to migrate the code to .NET Standard as well as the latest versions of Xamarin.Forms. 

Currently the Android library works but I still need to update the code associated with iOS.
